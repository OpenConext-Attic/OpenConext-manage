Pre-update actions
------------------
* Set up shell environment.

Edit */etc/profile* (as root or with sudo) and add:

    export APPLICATION_ENV="!!ENV!!"

Where "!!ENV!!" MUST be replace by your environment of choice.
Then open a new terminal to make sure you have the new environment.

* Set VERS environment.

Edit */etc/surfconext/manage.ini* and add:

    vers.env = "test"

or
    vers.env = "production"
